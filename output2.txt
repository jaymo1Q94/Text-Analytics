We have been made aware of rumors circulating that #coronavirus
cases have been confirmed in patients in multiple South Georgia
communities, including Albany. Those rumors are flatly untrue.
As of now, there are no #COVID-19 cases anywhere in South Georgia.
So far, only 2 patients in Georgia have tested positive for COVID-19,
both in metro Atlanta. Any positive coronavirus cases will be publicly
reported. An important way to minimize the spread of the illness and
keep our communities safe is by sharing accurate information.
Phoebe and our community health partners are committed to
providing that accurate and updated information daily.

The number of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases in
Georgia is growing, and there is evidence some groups of those
Cases are connected. Gov. Brian Kemp announced yesterday
several cases were connected to one church. With that, public
health officials are strongly encouraging southwest Georgians to
avoid congregating in large groups as #coronavirus continues to
spread.
The COC is encouraging Americans to practice social distancing.
According to the COC website, that means everyone “should avoid
crowded places where close contact may occur.” People should
also try to maintain a distance of approximately 6 feet from others.

Common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of
breath. Most people who contract the virus suffer relatively mild
symptoms that do not require hospitalization. Older individuals and
those with chronic conditions or compromised immune systems are
more likely to develop severe symptoms. Read more:

As the concern for a supply shortage increases, we are getting
creative and thinking outside the box. Over the weekend, a team of
supply chain, infection control and medical staff members went ta
work figuring out a way to mass produce facemasks that, for
instance, could be used by patients in the Phoebe Cancer Center
and employees doing mandatory temperature screenings at all
hospital entrances. Today, that creativity was put to work as a
group of #PhoebeFamily members started producing those masks
for potential use if the situation gets to a point where that is
necessary.
