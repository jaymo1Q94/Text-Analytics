that as many as 25% of Inatviduals Infected with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic. Additionally,
Science also now Informs us that individuals who are symptomatic, are Infectious up to 48
hours before symptoms appear. This nev information tells the health care community,
medical researchers, public health and governments why COVID-19 Is spreading so rapidly.
“Until now, containing the spread of COVID-19 has been based on carly detection and Isolation
of people with symptoms of the virus,” said Toomey. "Social distancing and keeping people
apart from cach other are now more than just recommendations; they are the Dest weapons we
have to stop the spread of COVID-19."
In addition to social distancing, all Georgians arc reminded to wash thelr hands frequently and
theroughly with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (60% alcohol) when
soap and water aren't available. Avoid touching your face, nose, mouth and eyes with
unwashed hands. Caver your coughs and sneezes with a tissue, and throw the used tissue in
the Wash.

Work with your health care provider to get and keep
an undetectable viral load. Being undetectable means your
viral load— the amount of HIV in your blood— is so low
that a test can’t detect it.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 7, 2020
Public Health Urges Proper Disposal of Masks and Gloves
ALBANY, GA-As the use of facemasks and gloves by the general public becomes more
frequent due to the risk of COVID-19, Public Health leaders urge everyone to properly dispose
of these items after use. Facemasks and gloves, as well as sanitizing wipes and other items
being used for disinfecting, should not be left in shopping carts, on the ground, in parking lots
or on sidewalks and neighborhood streets for others to risk exposure when they have to be
cleaned up.
For everyone's safety, these items should always be placed in the nearest trash can.
Disposable masks, gloves and sanitizing wipes are not meant to be processed by municipal
waste systems and should never be flushed, officials add. Please take responsibility for
yourself and your family members by not creating additional health risks during this pandemic.
